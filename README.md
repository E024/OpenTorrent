# OpenTorrent
A C#, Lidgren-based, P2P-fueled torrent sharing software. Actually just something I made for fun when KAT got shot down.

Features:
  - Centralized P2P network
  - Upload of torrent files
  - Download of direct magnet link, for ease of storage
  - Absolutely not wrapped up at 1 a.m code


*insert statement on freedom of sharing informations and on that by taking down torrenting website we're hurting that freedom*
